Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false


## Solution 
        sp = tp = 0
        while sp < len(s) and tp < len(t):
            if s[sp] == t[tp]:
                sp += 1
            tp += 1
            
        return sp == len(s) 
    
#Time complexity : O(len(t))
#Space complexity : O(1)
